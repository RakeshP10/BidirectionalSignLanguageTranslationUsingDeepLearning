# BidirectionalSignLanguageTranslationUsingDeepLearning
This is a desktop application with two main parts: 1. Sign-to-Text translation feature which allows 
users to input hand signatures and translates them into corresponding text. 2. The text-to-sign translation feature 
allows users to input text and generates related sign language signs. Additionally, the application includes a module to 
create GIFs related to sign language signs. The application also provides functionality to extend the sign database by 
allowing users to input new signs and associate them with specific letters using the keyboard. The sign-to-text 
translation is implemented using convolutional neural networks, while the text-to-sign translation is achieved through 
mapping techniques.
